    <h2>My Thoughts On Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>One of the best takeaways I've gathered from learning how to code is learning how to effectively problem solve. The best problem solving tip I've learned is to break everything down to the most simple core idea and expand out from there. If you're building an entire open world game with multiplayer and cross platform play, it can be tempting to try and tackle all of that at once and get overwhelmed. You may not even know where to start. Instead of trying to do everything at once, figure out what the most simple version of that game would look like.</p>
    <p>One simple way to break it down would be to just make a character that spawns onto a map. Then you add functionality for that player to move around. Then you make it so he can jump. Then you add functionality in for camera controls, then collision/projectiles. Then you add collectibles and powerups. You build it up layer by layer always starting with the most simple core idea and expanding. This keeps things simple, decoupled, and clean.</p>
    <p>Now I'm not an experienced game dev by any means. The most difficult thing I've built is a command line tic tac toe game, but the principles still remain the same. Start with the most simple possible iteration of something, and expand. I believe that is the idea behind progressive enhancement. You start with the content itself and don't bog yourself down with all of the complex details of how it will look or how it will behave until you're ready. Once the content has been compelted, then you style it. Once it's been styled, then you can add behavior.</p>
    <p>This helps keep the content separate from the design, and the design separate from the behavior. It allows all three phases to be updated and maintained independantly of each other.</p>

    <h2>Dragon/Course Reflection</h2>
    <p>For the past couple of years I have been trying to learn how to code using free online resources. I found that there was a ton of width the to free courses and online resources, but there was not as much depth. It was easy to learn a lot of beginner material for free, but not a great way to learn how to get to intermediate and beyond, so I found myself deciding to get a formal education in computer science.</p>
    <p>This meant that I had at least a beginner level knowledge of web development which helped me immensely during this course. Instead of having to learn all of the basics, I was able to focus on stretching my current abilities to make things. That's where I found myself with this dragon project. From the beginning I wanted to be really intentional about designing something that looked cohesive.</p>
    <p>I spent close to half a dozen hours researching web sites that I liked to get a feel for how I wanted my dragon website to look. I drew many sketches on my white board and came up with a ton of concepts. I eventually nailed down a few concepts for each section of the page and actually designed them in Figma. Once I could see a visual representation of each section I sketched, it became clear what needed to be fixed/tweaked.</p>
    <p>Coding was the easy part. I had all of the content, I knew how it needed to look, so all I needed to do was write the structure and CSS. I was actually gathering feedback from my brother and my girlfriend the whole time I was designing/building the web site, so the feedback I incorporated in the second draft if pretty minimal.</p>
    <p>All in all I really loved this project. It was a lot of fun trying to make something that looked really good and functioned well. I really appreciate all of the best practices that were taught as well as real-world practical advice on how to operate as a professional.</p>
