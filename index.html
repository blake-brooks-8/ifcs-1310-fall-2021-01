    <h2>My Thoughts On Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>One of the best takeaways I've gathered from learning how to code is learning how to effectively problem solve. The best problem solving tip I've learned is to break everything down to the most simple core idea and expand out from there. If you're building an entire open world game with multiplayer and cross platform play, it can be tempting to try and tackle all of that at once and get overwhelmed. You may not even know where to start. Instead of trying to do everything at once, figure out what the most simple version of that game would look like.</p>
    <p>One simple way to break it down would be to just make a character that spawns onto a map. Then you add functionality for that player to move around. Then you make it so he can jump. Then you add functionality in for camera controls, then collision/projectiles. Then you add collectibles and powerups. You build it up layer by layer always starting with the most simple core idea and expanding. This keeps things simple, decoupled, and clean.</p>
    <p>Now I'm not an experienced game dev by any means. The most difficult thing I've built is a command line tic tac toe game, but the principles still remain the same. Start with the most simple possible iteration of something, and expand. I believe that is the idea behind progressive enhancement. You start with the content itself and don't bog yourself down with all of the complex details of how it will look or how it will behave until you're ready. Once the content has been compelted, then you style it. Once it's been styled, then you can add behavior.</p>
    <p>This helps keep the content separate from the design, and the design separate from the behavior. It allows all three phases to be updated and maintained independantly of each other.</p>
